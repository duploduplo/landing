/* what's here?

	Here is the styling for the map div and its animation
	including the "secondary" classes which will be called
	on the div with javascript when needed such as
	* idle class	> 	stays where it is on 
						the first row of the content: 
	* static class	> 	transform in fixed div
						so it will stay put on the page 
						And also bring the loading animation
	* end class		>	which actually could be the idle one
						clears the styling e hide the div

	// MAP SHOULD BE IN THE FINAL ROW OF ITS APPEARANCE

	It will contain all the animations and special
	styling for the pins too for
	* positioning of single .pin-cont.pin#
	* timings of the animations (when they'll appear)

	Every pin will have a static position but will be
	hidden until the class that activates the animation 
	is called with javascript. after that they'll be visible
	and will disappear with all the map once we're through
	on the page
